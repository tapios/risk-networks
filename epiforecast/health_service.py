class HealthService:
    """
    Class to represent the actions of a health service for the population,
    This class is initiated with a full static network of health_workers
    and community known as the `static_population_network`. Patients are
    added from this population by removing their old connectivity and
    adding new contact edges to some `assigned health workers:

    |----------------network------------------|

    [health_worker 1: 'S']---[community 1: 'S']
                          \ /
                           X-[community 2: 'I']
                          / \
    [health_worker 2: 'S']---[community 3: 'H']

    |-----------------------------------------|

    The primary method of this class is:

    population_network = `discharge_and_admit_patients(current_statuses)`

    The output is a network identified with only human beings, known as the `population network`
    and the connectivity would be given by the following:

    (admit) Any `community` or `health_worker` node that (and not already a `patient`)
    with status 'H' (hospitalized)  will lose their edges connecting them to current
    neighbours and gain the edges of some health workers. If there is capacity to do so.
    We refer to them as a `patient`.

    (discharge) Any `patient` with status !='H' (i.e it is now resistant 'R' or deceased 'D') will lose
    the edges to their current `health_worker` neighbours and regain thier original neighbours.

    We perform first (discharge), then (admit) to gain new patients in the function.

    For example. Applying this function to the world network above yields the following.
    1) discharge: There is no one to discharge
    2) admit: `community 3` has status H and so is placed into hospital. They lose their community edges. We denote them `patient 1`.

    |---------------------Population network---------------------|

    [Patient 1: 'H']---[health_worker 1: 'S']---[community 1: 'S']
                    \                        \ /
                     \                        /-[community 2: 'I']
                      \                      /
                       [health_worker 2: 'S']
